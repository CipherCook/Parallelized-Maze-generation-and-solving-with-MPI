# COL380_A3
Distributed Programming Maze Generation and Solving with MPI

## TODO 
1. Separate out Kruskal's into a separate file
2. Add BFS Generation
3. Add solvers
4. Convert vectors to arrays for speed improvement later

### Report Specification for later
1. Using my_rank in local seeds to ensure correct randomness
2. 1d Wall to 2d Generation
3. Using 1d representation for solving
